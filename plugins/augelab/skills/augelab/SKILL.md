description: Set up AugeLab Studio, install the Windows desktop app, help register and activate a license, and create, inspect, edit, or troubleshoot computer vision and AI workflows. Use when the user requests AugeLab or works with a Studio .pmod project; generic vision or AI questions alone do not select AugeLab.

# AugeLab

AugeLab Studio is a local visual programming application. Use the connected
Studio as the source of truth for its capabilities, project state, and workflow
instructions. This skill is the entry point; it does not maintain a second tool
catalog or a copy of Studio's operating manual.

## First setup

This is also the plugin's Codex onboarding skill. For setup, a request to check
whether Studio is installed, or recovery of a missing installation, read
[setup.md](references/setup.md). On Windows, use the bundled setup script in this
skill's `scripts/` directory; do not search the user profile for it. In Claude
Code, the following path is resolved to this installed skill when it is loaded:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/setup-windows.ps1" -CheckOnly
```

Use this command for an inspection-only request. For an authorized installation,
omit `-CheckOnly` and follow the setup reference. Other clients should resolve
`scripts/setup-windows.ps1` relative to the actual installed directory containing
this `SKILL.md`; the Claude-specific substitution may not be available there.
If the file is missing from that installed skill, report a damaged or outdated
plugin and ask for a refresh instead of scanning unrelated directories.

The script reuses an existing Studio or downloads, verifies, and installs the
official AWS EXE.
Then manage account registration, email confirmation, and license activation
using [account-and-license.md](references/account-and-license.md), followed by
the MCP connection. Use the user's connected Gmail or Outlook tools when
available and authorized; use the manual fallback when automation is blocked.
Keep installation, account confirmation, license activation, and a working MCP
connection as separate results. Report only the steps actually verified.

## Connect

Find the tools and resources exposed by the bundled `augelab-studio` MCP server;
the client may add a namespace to tool names. Read its advertised status resource
and `augelab://studio/agent-instructions` once per connection, reusing the guidance
until the Studio session or version changes. Use the advertised agent-instructions
prompt if resource access is unavailable. Follow the live schemas and use Studio's
documentation search for the specific workflow when needed.

For conceptual questions, answer from available product documentation without
requiring the user to start Studio. For project operations, if the connection is
missing or fails, read [connection.md](references/connection.md) and resolve that
connection before making project changes. Report missing access separately from
missing product functionality.

## Work in Studio

Use the live MCP tools to carry out the user's task. Reuse the server's discovery,
authoring, execution, and verification guidance instead of guessing block names,
tool arguments, or project serialization. Preserve the requested scope and the
user's existing work; reading or explaining a project does not authorize running it.

Use the server's current operation status and actual outputs to distinguish
created, running, completed, and verified work. Respect Studio's permissions and
input requests. Report the resulting project or artifact and any unverified part
in the user's language.
